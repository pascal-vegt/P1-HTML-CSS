<h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>
    Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br>
    It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. <br>
    This is the basic building block of the web. <br>
    Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core. <br>
</p>
<h2>What are HTML-Elements?</h2>
<p>
    Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.
</p>
<h2>What is a tag?</h2>
<p>
    An element consists of an opening and closing tag. <br>
    The data supplied between the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element. <br>
</p>
<h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
<p>
    The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended the data to appear on the screen.
</p>
<h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>
<p>
    The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6
</p>
<h2>More Elements</h2>
<h3>A-Tag</h3>
<p>
    The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other areas within our own web page). <br>
    You will always see the ‘a’ element used with the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to. <br>

<h3>Img-tag</h3>
<p>
    This element will display an image on the screen. <br>
    It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which points to the address of the image to be displayed. <br>
    NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag: <br>
